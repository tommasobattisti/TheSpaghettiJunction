# Work connections on Wikidata: a preliminary analysis and report

>**Note**<br>
>Data's last update: Nov, 29 2022

## Introduction and contents
This document is compiled with the purpose of presenting some preliminary analyses for 'The Spaghetti Junction' project.

In particular, this study is a necessary step in order to better comprehend our subject of inquiry from the perspective of data and properties' inner connections within Wikidata. The aim is to draw a clear path that goeas from the particular to the more general context capable of highlighting connections-related lacks on Wikidata and potential contexts of enrichment.

An introductury analysis with a comparison of the connections between novels and films existing in both Wikipedia and Wikidata is followed by a "case study"-based evidence of the results achievable if Wikdata had more connections by using it combined with external sources. Finally, a broader inquiry shows what is the potential reach of the project by demonstrating how completely different entities (both creative and non creative works) are connected by means of the same properties, inducing us to think about the project's future perspectives and the possible benefits it would bring to Wikidata.

In this regard, the primary sections that compose the document are:
  1. [Work connections without works' class restriction](#Work-connections-without-works'-class-restriction) <br>
The first section highlights the results of the comparison between what can be extracted by querying Wikidata in terms of films based on novels and the data that can be found in the Wikipedia categories aimed at describing the same phenomenon. The purpose of this analysis is to estimate potential divergencies in terms of representation and amount of available data. 
  
  2. [The case of Italian literature and international cinema and television](#The-case-of-Italian-literature-and-international-cinema-and-television) <br>
  The second section focuses on a specific case study: Italian literature and international cinema and television. The possibility of quantifying links on Wikidata about literary works by Italian authors and derivative audiovisual works is compared with the amount of data that can be retrieved by combining Wikidata potential with an external source (in this particular case, IMDb).
  
  3. [Authors, works, and derivative works on Wikidata only](#Authors-works-and-derivative-works-on-Wikidata-only) <br>
  Given the results of the previous sections, the third one starts to extend the point of view by moving the focus on the relations between written and audiovisual works in general. 
  
  4. [Final comparison and conclusion](#Conclusion) <br>
  In this final section, the context is even more enrlarged. In fact, while still dealing with the reletionship bewteen works and derivative works, the analysis take into account entities without considering their nature. Not only written or audiovisual works are retrieved here, but any kind of work derived from another work and vice versa.

The last two sections contain alsotables useful to better appriciate and compare how different propertie of our interest are used for entities linking.
